# Split Captain


### What is this? 
Welcome aboard, it's great to have you. I'll give you a quick tour of the ship and then show you to your quarters. Right so this was inspired by [pomkos's payme](https://github.com/pomkos/payme) and I have re-shipped it using the very fun Svelte, Firebase, Tailwindcss, and hosted on Vercel. What a combo!

### Can I drive the ship?

Sure, setup is just `yarn start`, and enjoy yourself while the non-snowpack using boats are left in your wake.

### What it does.

This will be updated as development goes on. So far, I've got:

- voyage (room) support, with any number of crew-people joining, though to be honest I haven't tested it with more than a few so far. 
- real-time updating of shared objects such as provisions (receipt line items) and name tags (user information). 
- a pretty cool ship (avatar) selection process
- some semi-complete assets

### What it needs to do
- attaching tags to provisions
- output totals per person
- deeplink to venmo

### What on the wishlist
- receipt item extraction from image
- more support for different platforms
